/**
 * A value object is an object with no conceptual identity that describe a domain aspect (u care about what they are not who they are).
 * Value Objects allow declaring entity properties with explicit types that use the ubiquitous language.
 * Value Objects can define how they can be explicitly created and what operations can be performed within and between them
 *
 * taken form (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/microservice-domain-model)
 * Something that is an entity in a microservice might not be an entity in another microservice,
 * because in the second case, the Bounded Context might have a different meaning.
 * For example, an address in an e-commerce application might not have an identity at all,
 * since it might only represent a group of attributes of the customer's profile for a person or company.
 * In this case, the address should be classified as a value object.
 * However, in an application for an electric power utility company, the customer address could be important for the business domain.
 * Therefore, the address must have an identity so the billing system can be directly linked to the address.
 * In that case, an address should be classified as a domain entity.
 *
 *
 * entities are considered equal if their identities are the same and
 * Value objects are not just wrapper types around primitive types,
 * value objects equality is established by value; hence the name value objects.
 * since the value objects we created productId and vendorId are class instances a
 * normal equal operation on those will result in checking equality of reference objects
 * which will fail .
 *
 * please referer to entitiesUsingValueObjects.ts
